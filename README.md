# HarvestMate
Harvest Mate is a smart planter that helps growing micro-greens at home for human consumption. The planter is embedded with sensors measuring the PH, ambient and soil humidity, temperature and light intensity. The user is notified when the plants need water and from data we wish to predict when to plant and harvest the greens.
